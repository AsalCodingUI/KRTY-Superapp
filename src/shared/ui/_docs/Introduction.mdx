# The Olympus Design System

Welcome to the Olympus Design System for the Kretya Superapp. This system provides a unified set of components, design tokens, and guidelines to ensure consistency, accessibility, and high quality across the application.

## Core Principles

### 1. 🔱 Foundation First

Everything is built on a solid foundation of design tokens (colors, spacing, typography). Changing a token updates the entire system.

### 2. 🏛️ Semantic Usage

Use components and tokens according to their semantic meaning, not just their visual appearance.

- Use `primary` for main actions.
- Use `danger` for destructive actions.
- Use `surface` for backgrounds.

### 3. ⚖️ Accessibility (A11y)

All components are designed to be accessible by default. We follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Always check:

- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast

## System Architecture

The system is organized into the following categories:

- **Action**: Buttons, Dropdowns, Toggles
- **Information**: Badges, Callouts, Stats
- **Input**: Forms, Pickers, Sliders
- **Interaction**: Accordions, Tabs
- **Overlay**: Dialogs, Drawers, Tooltips
- **Structure**: Cards, Tables, Layouts
- **Data**: Data Tables, Visualization

## Getting Started

To use a component, import it from the shared UI barrel file:

```tsx
import { Button, Card } from "@/shared/ui"

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <h1>Hello Olympus</h1>
      <Button>Click Me</Button>
    </Card>
  )
}
```
